#This program serves as a working basis to build off from,
#rather than a complete project. All this program will do is:
#    retrieve the texts of various set Shakespeare works
#    trim/format the text for better usability,
#    and use regex functions to find basic word counts/patterns to analyze.
#Set IDs for each book to retrieve from gutenberg.org are used for testing.
#This is for simplicity and to minimalize data scraped from their servers.
#Future options include scraping a mirror site, working off downloaded text files,
#or using their publicly available catalog metadata.
